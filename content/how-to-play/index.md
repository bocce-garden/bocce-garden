Equipment
=========
I've used rocks that were different enough in color to tell the teams apart, but a good set is worth having.
Weight matters, so does size, but having anything is better than not.

Each player has some number of balls, usually 2-4. There is also a smaller target ball called a polino.
I have a set with two balls in four colors; this lets me play with 2 - 8 people.

Setting
=======
I prefer open spaces with some varying textures of surface where I can roam around a bit.
I also look for some hills and bushes and trees and whatnot to make each round different than the last.

Think somewhere between a zen garden and a miniature golf course.

Play
====

Deliberate and fuss and let somebody go first.
It's easiest to go first and hardest to go last.

At the beginning of each round, everyone agrees to their starting location.
Moving around a bit is fine, but 6ft to the other side of another player might be considered a faux pax.

The winner of the last round starts the next by tossing the polino somewhere that looks like a good game to them.
Everyone takes turns throwing one with last round's winner going last.

Sometimes I'll walk a little bit from where we ended up last, but not often far.

Hitting any of the balls currently in play, including the target ball, is legal.

Scoring a Round
===============
The closest to the polino is the winner of the round.

They get as many points for each ball closer than the other colors.

For example, if red gets one point with the closest ball:

Red would get two if two were closer:

Game End
========
Depending on how long we want per game, I'll play to 7 or 11
