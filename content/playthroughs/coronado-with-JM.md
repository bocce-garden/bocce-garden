## Church

I wait for today's partner in a church she works at.

She plays the pipe organ and I'm drinking tea while she practices for Sunday.

They have PG Tips and it continues to be the least amount of a thing you could still consider tea.

Sparks and swells of grandeur fall away to page turning and quick notes and sharp mumbling.

The stained glass is beautiful in this loud and silent place.

## Matheson Park

We had some ideas about where to play on Coronado, but this is the first place that caught our eye other than the expanse of the cordoned off golf course.

Starting at the top of the hill, we throw towards some kids playing on the far side.

The palm trees are lego city perfect because we are in Coronado.

The lush grass pulls nicely at our throws.

We really get to huck em out a bit to get them to roll at all.

There were a handful of thinner spots, but the whole park was nice grass at a gentle cant.

Turned my thoughts back to PG Tips.

Sometimes a simple thing is perfect and nice and just what you need.
