People have been throwing things around and calling themselves the winner for a few thousand years.
It sits on the psyche well to putz and to talk.

Bocce is usually played in a long wooden rectangle with a uniform gravel surface, but this blog is about good spots for roaming around more like golf.
Unlike golf, this blog will only feature free public spaces, so keep things nice, smoke in designated areas and be respectful.

While there are some [excellent](https://www.openstreetmap.org/query?lat=32.73100&lon=-117.14155#map=18/32.73107/-117.14045) places to put a dedicated bocce garden, so far none exist that I'm aware of.
I'm taking pictures and notes for how to design a dedicated bocce garden, so reach out if you're thinking of building one!

If you're interested in playing or have a good spot to recommend, send me an email!
