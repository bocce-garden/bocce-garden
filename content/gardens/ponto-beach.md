![Ponto Beach Bocce](/img/ponto-beach-jennie-marie.png)

Winter waves pushed the sand up high for an excellent play session with brief cliffs over round rocks tumbled in the surf.
Some nice open sand, windswept and walked over in between some more topologically interesting features in the beach.
Be careful of the habitat restoration areas cordoned off, there are some plants and birds and whatnot that don't have a whole lot of space to grow these days.
This beach has some special memories for me, something about the ever present wind and noise of the surf seem to make the conversations loud and quiet and intimate and distant.
For the same reasons this beach is so interesting for bocce, I've seen a number of RC cars kicking up sand up and down the beach!
This beach has kind of a shelf for most of the length of it, so as much as it might feel like the bocce balls are going to roll into the ocean, there's actually not much of a chance of that.

Maybe bring a towel!
