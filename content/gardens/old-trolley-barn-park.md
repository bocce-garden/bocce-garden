This park is a lovely park with families always crowded around the play equipment.
There is also a really nice view over Mission Valley with some benches.

The play space is a little plain, but not every trip needs to be a big destination thing.
The small grove of eucalyptus trees can be used as an obstacle, but I found myself more drawn to the 'demented hill' near the fenced off drainage in the center of the park.

Some off leash dogs got a bit curious about us throwing balls that weren't for them, but wandered off when they felt that they weren't soft like a tennis ball...

I definitely look for more topologically interesting places with more obstacles, but there's plenty of space for the slow hills to make a fairly interesting game.
A little simple, but super easy to get to for anyone living in the city center!

[Lancer's](https://the-lancers.business.site/), [Park & Rec](http://parkandrecsd.com/) and the excellent [Diversionary Theater](https://www.diversionary.org/) are right around the corner, so get ready for date night!
