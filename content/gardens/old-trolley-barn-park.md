This park is a lovely park with families always crowded around the play equipment.
There is also a really nice view over Mission Valley with some benches.

The play space is a little plain, but not every trip needs to be a big destination thing.
I love how the eucalyptus trees shade the gradually curving hillside.

A little simple, but super easy to get to for anyone living in the city center!
