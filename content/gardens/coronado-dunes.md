This is the best bang for your buck that I've found for bocce in San Diego.
This spot is the word 'Coronado' written out in sand dunes.
I don't know that I could really tell from standing there, but from the satellite image on the map you sure can.

I love the variety of elevation changes and mottled diversity of iceplant, hardpack and soft sand.
The dunes themselves can be six to eight feet in elevation change, which affords some excellent play up and on top as well as down and in some interesting bowls.
The ice plant is a fun obstacle, completely catching your throw if you don't quite make it past a swath of it.

There are a few sections that allow some longer rolls, but this space is a bit more defined by interesting topology and obstacles.
