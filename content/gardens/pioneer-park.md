I lived in Little Italy for years without knowing about this little gem up in Mission Hills.
Visit some super old gravestones!
Bask under a pepper tree!
Roll some bocce balls over all kinds of different textures due to the intermittent trees and bald patches of grass!
Commune with spirits of ages past since this whole park used to be a cemetary!

Maybe get some pizza from Lefty's nearby!
Or brunch at the Huddle!
Or a movie at [Cinema Under the Stars](https://www.topspresents.com/)!

I don't know what time a day your date will be, but this place is real cute!
