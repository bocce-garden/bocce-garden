Pioneer Park is a lovely hidden gem in Mission Hills.
The park features some gentle rolling hills as well as a few not so gentle hills that lead into some unplayful dropoffs.
There are some smoother sections, but this park features a lot of exposed roots and gophers holes for some delightfully chaotic play.
The low ceiling of pepper, fig and jacaranda branches are fun obstacles, grabbing at shots angled up too high for the spirits of the park to approve.

One round had a ball roll down towards the historic adobe wall.
Luckily the ball stopped before ending up in the street or finding it's way into a windshield.

I think if you're a little prudent with choosing playable rounds, you'll have plenty of fun.

One gentleman did made a point to say that we should be playing in a flat pitch, but he was obvously some nerd who hates fun.
Unlike Leslie 🐟, who is a nerd who excells at fun.

I'll often find myself over here after visiting [The Huddle](https://www.thehuddlerestaurant.com/), [Lefty's Pizza](https://leftyspizza.com/mission-hills/), or [Cinema Under the Stars](https://www.topspresents.com/) right down the street.

I hope the old grove, headstones and creepy vines give you an ethereal air to your meandering!
