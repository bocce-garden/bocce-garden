While this park has yet to have it's grand opening, I've been seeing my instagram blow up with skaters taking advantage of the excellent concrete trail that meanders around the river banks.
The park is nestled between Snapdragon stadium, the 15 and the 8.
If you're inclined to use public transportation, there is a trolley stop right up the hill.
The whole area is still under fairly active development, but this is a very nice park, in stark contrast to the weird property developer not-exactly-a-park that is Civita nearby.
The park features a few fields large enough to play soccer on, so get ready for a few long shots!
The eastern of these fields near the trolley station features some rolling hills with an excellent topology for Bocce!

Over on this side of the park, there's a nice overlook with a few picnic benches for your water and snacks.
This big flat grass field is hugged by a crescent of gentle rolling hills that are large enough to push your throws ten or twenty feet off course, but with enough change to the curve to where you might need to accomodate a few ups and downs before you get near your target ball.
This place is great for longer pitches, with an even enough rolling surface for the hills to take effect in a gradual but very noticeable way.
Most places that have similar hills have a much rougher rolling surface, leading to more unpredictable results.
On those I'll tend toward a shorter game so it's a bit more skill than luck, but this place has a really nice middle ground between complete chaos and the old school sandbox.

There is a bunch of fun play equipment under the trolley including a labyrinth that is very much worth the meditative walk.

I'm excited to see the rest of the park as it opens!
