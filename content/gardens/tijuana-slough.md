I've scoped this spot from across the estuary from one of the hiking trails that cut through the cholla.
There were some dunes that seemed attractive, so I tried walking south from this cul-de-sac in IB.

Much of the dunes were cordoned off as nature rehabilitation, but there was enough of this dreamy beach to play on that I still wanted to mention this location.

I hear a lot of contention about the pollution of the ocean in this area, it's hard to say if it's sewage or chemicals from the military.

This place is undeniably beautiful, but potentially hazardous to your health.
