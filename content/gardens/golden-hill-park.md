Golden Hill Park is a little section of Balboa park cut off from the rest by main roads and the nearby golf course.
To be frank, I mostly come here late at night to see the planes after some dinner and drins at the Turf Supper Club down the street.
I love the way the wind whips a few moments after the jets pass overhead.

This park is lovely.
I get a little lost in time or place in the short scattered palm garden and massive fig trees.

As far as play textures, at least in the spring, the grass is thick, the gophers are around and the rain has exposed many roots.
We found ourselves splitting between flagging the target ball with a stick and dealing with the imperfect information of not exactly knowing where it was.

Especially with this particular guest, [Batya](https://bmacadamsomer.wordpress.com/), the conversation is the highlight.
Bocce does tend to just be the cracker, a vehicle for conversational cheese.
We drift through discussing different organizations we have related to, how they make decisions, how they make money, what community they support.
How sustainable those different models are.

Maybe we're just "solving the world's problems".

Right now I'm coordinating with specific individuals to go play, but soon I'll be hosting meetups!
