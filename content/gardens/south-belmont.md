Between the parking lot south of Belmont park and the rest of South Mission is a lovely little grass section strewn with some short hills and dotted with picnic tables and charcoal grills.
Excellent views of the skaters at the boardwalk, like Ben Faust from Free Skate Fridays, put on by the [JMK / freeskate](https://usa.jmkride.com) folks.

There are some fun lines through this sonic the hedgehog level 1 looking park.
There are still enough picnic tables with concrete foundations and children about that you'll need to be a little choosy about which direction you head.

Very fun hill topology!

Great mix of grass textures!

There are a few good spots in the area, but scope where I'm talking about specifically at [South Belmont on OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/32.76811/-117.25211)
