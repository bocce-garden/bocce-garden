I am excited to announce a monthly meetup for a free-roving session of bocce in various parks around SoCal!

If you'd like to join, send an email to:

[bocce-gardeners+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:bocce-gardeners+subscribe@googlegroups.com)

When you get the 'verify request to join' email, please reply to the email rather than click the button in the email.

This will send me a request for you to join.
I'll let you in before I send out any notifications for our next meetup.

This game is 100% about getting to know people in the very human-friendly medium of walking around and throwing stuff, so I'm super excited about what might develop!

Looking forward to meeting you!
