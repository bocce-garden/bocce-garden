I am excited to announce a monthly meetup for those who dig this bocce jam! I was a little suprised to see that this website had -any- traffic, so I thought I might try engaging with those folks for the sake of some community.

This will give us a way to coordinate outside of me texting my friends so I could open up the session to the public.

If you'd like to join, send an email to:

[bocce-gardeners+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:bocce-gardeners+subscribe@googlegroups.com)

When you get the 'verify request to join' email, reply to the email rather than click the button they give.

This will send me a request for you to join (which might be some days or weeks before I check it), but I'll let you in before I send out any notifications for our next meetup.

This game is 100% about getting to know people in the very human-friendly medium of walking around and throwing stuff, so I'm super excited about what might develop!

Looking forward to meeting you!
